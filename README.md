# 🤖 Terminal Bench Agentic Data Pipeline

**TL;DR:** A multi-agent system with 20+ Claude Code instances working in parallel to generate high-quality training data for terminal-based coding tasks, with focus on **backend software engineering** scenarios.

**Primary Focus: Backend Software Engineering**

This pipeline generates repository-level, realistic backend engineering tasks including:
- API development (REST, GraphQL, WebSocket)
- Database operations, migrations, and query optimization
- Debugging and refactoring in complex codebases
- Testing infrastructure (unit, integration, end-to-end)
- Real-world developer scenarios targeting ~20% pass rate on SOTA models

**Why build an agentic data pipeline?**

Because generating quality training data for coding agents requires creativity, validation, and scale—tasks perfectly suited for AI collaboration.

## 🏗️ High-Level Architecture

The pipeline transforms Terminal Bench evaluation tasks into diverse training datapoints through three specialized agent stages:

1. **Seed tasks** from Terminal Bench → **Idea Agents** → Creative variations
2. **Draft ideas** → **Builder Agents** → Complete executable datapoints  
3. **Built datapoints** → **Review Agents** → Production-ready training data

All agents work independently in parallel, coordinated by a central Task Manager that prevents duplication and handles failures.

## 🔄 Agent Roles & Workflow

![Single DP Journey](./readme_images/single-dp-journey.png)

Each agent type operates independently with specialized tools and clear responsibilities:

### 🎨 Idea Generation Agents
- **Input**: Seed tasks from Terminal Bench
- **Process**: Analyze core skills → Generate n×multiplier variations → Select best ideas
- **Output**: Draft specifications in shared workspace

**Key Innovation**: Refinement criteria provided only AFTER brainstorming to maximize creativity

### 🔨 Datapoint Builder Agents  
- **Input**: Draft specifications from idea agents
- **Process**: Build complete scenarios → Validate via software script → Iterate until passing
- **Output**: Executable datapoints with all required components

**Validation Requirements**:
- ✅ Dockerfile builds successfully
- ✅ Tests fail before agent intervention
- ✅ All dependencies present
- ✅ Test weights sum to 1.0

### 🔍 Quality Review Agents
- **Input**: Validated datapoints from builders
- **Process**: Check quality standards → Edit if needed → Re-validate → Categorize
- **Output**: Approved datapoints with metadata or rejection with reasons

## 📊 Task Manager System

The Task Manager enables parallel agent coordination without complex handoffs:

```python
# Agent claims work atomically
task = tm.get_next_task("idea-agent-07", task_types=["generate_idea"])

# Process independently
draft_ideas = generate_creative_variations(task["seed_data"])

# Complete with results
tm.complete_task(task["id"], "idea-agent-07", {"drafts": draft_ideas})
```

**Features**:
- Atomic task claiming (no collisions)
- Automatic timeout recovery
- Parent-child task tracking
- Real-time status monitoring

---

## 📁 Datapoint Structure

Each training datapoint contains:

```
draft_001_a/
├── prompt.md       # 1-3 sentence task (e.g., "Auth times out with 100+ users. Fix it.")
├── dockerfile      # Ubuntu 24.04 (or similar) environment setup
├── tests.py        # Pytest verification functions
├── weights.json    # Test importance distribution
└── files/          # Additional resources
    ├── app.py      # Broken code to fix
    └── config.json # Configuration files
```

---

## ✅ Validation Pipeline

Shared validation tools ensure quality across all agents:

1. **Docker Build**: Environment must build successfully
2. **Test Discovery**: Pytest must find all test functions
3. **Fail-First**: Tests must fail in initial state
4. **Dependency Check**: All required packages present
5. **Weight Validation**: Test weights sum to exactly 1.0

- **Separation of concerns**: Each agent excels at one task
- **Parallel scaling**: Multiple instances per type
- **Quality gates**: Three-stage validation ensures high standards

### Why Shared Filesystem?

- **Reliability**: File operations are atomic
- **Debugging**: Easy to inspect intermediate states

### Why Task Manager?
- **Coordination**: Prevents duplicate work
- **Recovery**: Handles agent failures gracefully
- **Monitoring**: Real-time pipeline visibility
