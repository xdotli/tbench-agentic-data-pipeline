The ETL migration script keeps re-processing all batches from the beginning every time it runs, even though we're saving checkpoint data. After a crash during the orders phase, I restarted the migration expecting it to resume where it left off, but it's starting over from users phase again and creating duplicate records. The checkpoint table stays empty even though the code looks like it should be writing to it.
