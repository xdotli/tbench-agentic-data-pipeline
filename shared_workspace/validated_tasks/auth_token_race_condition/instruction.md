Our auth gateway is having issues under load - users are getting randomly logged out and seeing "invalid refresh token" errors when multiple requests hit at the same time. The `/auth/refresh` endpoint works fine with sequential requests but fails intermittently when the same refresh token gets processed by multiple gateway instances concurrently. Pretty sure there's a race condition in the token refresh logic where the read-validate-delete-create operations aren't atomic.
